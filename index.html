    <p>I'm a transplanted Charleston Native of 15 years. I've spent all 15 years in the Charleston technology industry at different companies - mostly in client facing/support roles. I decided to do TIY because I wanted something with more stability that would allow me to build hard-skills that would translate across companies</p>
    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <p>Javascript, Python, Node.JS, Ruby, and any other language that will get me a job</p>
